# Asteroid Attack Javascript Game
Asteroid Attack is a simple 2D game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. In this game, the player controls a spaceship to avoid incoming asteroids and survive as long as possible.

The game features:
- Randomly generated asteroids of different sizes and speeds.
- Collision detection between the spaceship and the asteroids.
- Simple keyboard controls for the spaceship's movement.
- Visual effects for collisions and explosions.
- A score system that tracks the player's surviving time.

This project is a fun way to learn and practice game development with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. You can customize the game with your own graphics and sound effects, and add more features to make it more challenging and engaging.
